# Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix clone app built on ReactJS. I used [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movies. There is login page but it doesn't require any authentication. If you want to check the app, you can go to [Live Demo](https://netflix-clone-app-react-js.netlify.app/login).
